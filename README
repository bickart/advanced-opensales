Advanced OpenSales for SugarCRM features an advanced, robust set of business extensions
for sales and support management and inventory control including Quotes, Invoices
Products and Contracts modules.

The advanced-opensales package will not install on SugarCRM correctly if downloaded 
from GitHub. Please download the package from the SalesAgility website at 
http://www.salesagility.com/index.php/advanced-opensales

Alternatively, once you have downloaded the package from GitHub you can unzip the folder, 
move into the new extracted folder and then zip up the files and folders within this folder 
to create a new package. This package should then install correctly.
